Files Next Word Prediction-App

This is the repository including all files related to my next word prediction-app published here:
https://urli2016.shinyapps.io/Next_Word_Prediction/

This app is the final capstone project of the Data Science Specialization from Coursera. The goal of this project is to create a product
with the prediction algorithm used and to provide an interface that can be accessed by others. For this project I had to submit:

1. A Shiny app that takes as input a phrase (multiple words) in a text box input and outputs a prediction of the next word.
2. A slide deck consisting of no more than 5 slides created with R Studio Presenter (https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/
   200486468-Authoring-R-Presentations) pitching my algorithm and app as if I was presenting to a future boss or an investor.
